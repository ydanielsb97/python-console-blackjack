# Blackjack Game

## How to Win

The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21; a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust.

The goal of each player is to beat the dealer by having the higher, unbusted hand.

## Basic Rules


1. If the dealer has blackjack and the player doesn't, the player automatically loses.
2. If the player has blackjack and the dealer doesn't, the player automatically wins.
3. If both the player and dealer have blackjack then it's a push.
4. If neither side has blackjack, then each player plays out his hand, one at a time.
When all the players have finished the dealer plays his hand.
